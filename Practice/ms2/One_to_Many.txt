Overview:
Create a Spring Boot application with two entities: "Project" and "Employee". A project can 
have multiple employees assigned to it, while each employee can be part of only one project. Implement a 
one-to-many bidirectional mapping between these entities using Spring JPA. Utilize JPQL for retrieving 
details and incorporate handling for DuplicateProjectException.

Functional Requirements:
Project Structure: Create folders named controller, model, repository, exception, and service inside 
WORKSPACE/springapp/src/main/java/com/examly/springapp.

Model Classes:

Project:
Attributes:
id - int (auto-generated primary key)
projectName - String
budget - double
employees - List<Employee> (OneToMany, mappedBy = "project", @JsonManagedReference)

Note-one employee can work in one Project only, if tried to assign second project raise 
ProjectAlreadyAssignedException
Employee:
Attributes:
employeeId - int (auto-generated primary key)
name - String -all fileds are compulsary if anyone is missing raise InvalidDetailsException
role - String
salary- double
maritalStatus- boolean
dateOfBirth- LocalDate (must be less than current date otherwise throw custom exception- InvalidDateOfBirthExeption)
project - Project (ManyToOne, @JsonBackReference)

LocalDate ld=LocalDate.now();
ld.isBefore(LocalDate.of(2025, 9,20)));


Repository Interfaces:

ProjectRepo
EmployeeRepo
Service Interfaces and Implementations:

Interfaces: ProjectService and EmployeeService
Implementations: ProjectServiceImpl and EmployeeServiceImpl
Controllers:

ProjectController
EmployeeController
Custom Exception:

DuplicateProjectException
API Endpoints:
POST - /project - Create a new project. Returns response status 201 on successful creation or 
status 500 with an error message if a project with the same name already exists.

POST- /employee- create employee returs 201 on successful operation

//POST - /employee/{projectId}/assign - Assign an employee to a project. Returns response status 201 on 
//successful assignment or status 500 on failure.

POST - /employee/{employeeId}/project/{projectId}/assign - Assign an employee to a project. Returns response status 
201 on successful assignment or status 500 on failure.

GET - /project/{projectId} - Retrieve project details, including assigned employees. Returns response 
status 200 on success or status 404 if not found.

GET - /employee - Retrieve all employees. Returns response status 200 on success or status 404 if 
none exist.

GET - /employee/sorted - Retrieve all employees sorted by role in ascending order. Returns response 
status 200 on success or status 404 if no employees are found.

DELETE - /employee/{employeeId} - Delete an employee by ID. Returns response status 200 on successful 
deletion or an error message if not found.

Platform Guidelines:
To run the project, navigate to the springapp directory and use the command mvn spring-boot:run. 
Ensure your MySQL database is running and configured properly.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that you handle exceptions, particularly for DuplicateProjectException, when attempting to 
create a project with an existing name. Follow the structure and naming conventions for a clean 
implementation.

Create a Spring Boot application with two entities: "Library" and "Book". A library can have 
multiple books, and each book belongs to only one library. Implement a one-to-many bidirectional 
mapping between these entities using Spring JPA. Utilize JPQL for retrieving details and incorporate 
handling for DuplicateLibraryException.

Functional Requirements:
Project Structure: Create folders named controller, model, repository, exception, and service inside 
WORKSPACE/springapp/src/main/java/com/examly/springapp.

Model Classes:

Library:
Attributes:
libraryId - int (auto-generated primary key)
name - String
location - String
numOfBooks - int
books - List<Book> (OneToMany, mappedBy = "library", @JsonManagedReference)
Book:
Attributes:
bookId - int (auto-generated primary key)
title - String
author - String
genre - String
library - Library (ManyToOne, @JsonBackReference)
Repository Interfaces:

Custom Exception:

DuplicateLibraryException
Service Interfaces and Implementations:

API Endpoints:
POST - /library - Create a new library. Returns response status 201 on successful creation or status 500 with an 
error message if a library with the same name already exists.

POST - /book/{libraryId}/add - Add a book to a library. Returns response status 201 on successful 
addition or status 500 on failure.

GET - /library/{libraryId} - Retrieve library details, including its books. Returns response status 200 
on success or status 404 if not found.

GET - /book - Retrieve all books. Returns response status 200 on success or status 404 if none exist.

GET - /book/{author} - Retrieve books by the specified author. Returns response status 200 on success 
or status 404 if no books are found. Use the @Query annotation in the respective repository class.

DELETE - /book/{bookId} - Delete a book by ID. Returns response status 200 on successful deletion or 
an error message if not found.

Platform Guidelines:
To run the project, navigate to the springapp directory and use the command mvn spring-boot:run. 
Ensure your MySQL database is running and configured properly.

Additional Notes:
Make sure to handle exceptions for DuplicateLibraryException when attempting to create a library with
an existing name. Follow the structure and naming conventions for a clean implementation.

Create a Spring Boot application with two entities: "Store" and "Product". A store can have multiple 
products, and a product can belong to only one store. Implement a one-to-many bidirectional mapping 
between these entities using Spring JPA. Utilize JPQL for retrieving details and incorporate handling 
for DuplicateStoreException.
